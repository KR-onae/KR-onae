# IMPORTANT NEWS

I WILL DON'T USE THIS GITHUB ACCOUNT MORE.
MIGRATE TO ['KRonaeGit'](https://github.com/KRonaeGit) !

## Cause
1. The dash symbol (-) in 'KR-onae' is being transferred because it is not supported in some places.
2. I would like to organize too many but useless repositories. (Important repositories will be moved to KRonaeGit. EzAjax, KoreanCombiner, ColorAI, ENB64, JWH, Roost, Connection, Kixel, NoteBlock-Master, EFMF, MorseZ, etc)
3. I want to create a GitHub account for testing.

For these three reasons, I migrate to KRonaeGit.
